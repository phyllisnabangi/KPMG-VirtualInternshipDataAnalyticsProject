# KPMG Virtual Internship DataAnalytics Project 
It includes the tasks done as a Data Analytics Intern during my Virtual Internship period at KPMG with [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/m7W4GMqeT3bh9Nb2c/Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship).  
Worked on a case study of a client Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation to help them on making their marketing strategy using data insights.  
The following main tasks were completed
1. Data Quality Assesment
2. Data Insights
3. Data Insights and Presentations<br />
## Note
The dataset is not shared since it is only used for KPMG Virtual Internship purposes only. 
This should act as a guide but not to replicate the codes.
